        <p>
            I have a friend that's trying to get me to built for his startup non-profit organization.
            He had a CS major from whitman to design it for him, but that person ended up graduating and 
            she didn't do very much work on the project. I also think that what he is doing is cool, and 
            I would like to help him out. 

            For this project, I would like to build a shell for his website that would include different kinds of functionality 
            that could be useful to the organization. For purposes of this class, I think the design will be mostly experimental; 
            I can add features to it that might or might not be useful for the end product but it will ultimately 
            be something that I can hopefully use to for this project that I am embarking on.

            App Ideas
        <ul>
            <li>A place for <a href="https://www.quackit.com/html/codes/comment_box_code.cfm">comment submissions:</a>
                I think this would be useful to have on the website so that anyone who might questions about the organization 
                and it's policies could get in contact with him.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.jimdo.com/blog/donate-button-to-your-website/">A portal for donations:</a> 
                This will be the main function of the website, but I don't know if I will do this for this project. 
                I don't know how involved or safe it is, but it's something that I want to look into.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://codepen.io/Viruz/pen/QadJxO">discussion board</a> for posting stories/testimonials: 
                this is also an idea that may not be in the final website but I am interesting in learning how to make it happen.</li>
